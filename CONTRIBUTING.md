## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

#### Naming Conventions

- **Types**: Use `PascalCase` for types, protocols, and extensions
- **Functions**: Use `camelCase` for functions and methods
- **Variables**: Use `camelCase` for variables and constants
- **Constants**: Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for global constants

### Documentation

All public APIs must be documented:

```swift
/// Manages enterprise app deployment and distribution.
///
/// This class provides comprehensive enterprise deployment capabilities including
/// MDM integration, app distribution, and compliance monitoring.
public class EnterpriseDeployment {
    /// Deploys an app bundle to enterprise devices.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - app: The app bundle to deploy
    ///   - devices: Optional list of target devices
    /// - Throws: `DeploymentError` if deployment fails
    /// - Returns: Deployment result with status and metadata
    public func deploy(app: AppBundle, to devices: [Device]? = nil) async throws -> DeploymentResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Testing

All code changes must include appropriate tests:

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import EnterpriseDeploymentCore

final class EnterpriseDeploymentTests: XCTestCase {
    var deployment: EnterpriseDeployment!
    var mockConfiguration: Configuration!
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        mockConfiguration = Configuration()
        deployment = EnterpriseDeployment(configuration: mockConfiguration)
    }
    
    func testDeploymentSuccess() async throws {
        // Given
        let appBundle = AppBundle.mock()
        
        // When
        let result = try await deployment.deploy(app: appBundle)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(result.status, .success)
        XCTAssertNotNil(result.metadata)
    }
}
```
