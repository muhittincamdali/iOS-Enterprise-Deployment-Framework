## Overview

This guide will help you get started with the iOS Enterprise Deployment Framework. You'll learn how to set up the framework, configure your first deployment, and understand the core concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **macOS 12.0+** (Monterey or later)
- **Xcode 15.0+** with iOS 15.0+ SDK
- **Swift 5.9+** programming language
- **Git** version control system
- **Apple Developer Account** (for App Store and TestFlight)
- **Enterprise MDM Solution** (for enterprise deployment)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhittincamdali/iOS-Enterprise-Deployment-Framework.git
cd iOS-Enterprise-Deployment-Framework
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
swift package resolve
```

### 3. Open in Xcode

```bash
open Package.swift
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup

```swift
import EnterpriseDeploymentFramework

// Initialize deployment manager
let deploymentManager = EnterpriseDeploymentManager()

// Configure deployment settings
let deploymentConfig = DeploymentConfiguration()
deploymentConfig.enableAutomatedDeployment = true
deploymentConfig.enableRollbackSupport = true
deploymentConfig.enableMonitoring = true

// Start deployment manager
deploymentManager.start(with: deploymentConfig)
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```swift
// Configure production environment
deploymentManager.configureEnvironment(.production) { config in
    config.apiBaseUrl = "https://api.company.com"
    config.analyticsEnabled = true
    config.featureFlags = ["new_feature": false]
}

// Configure staging environment
deploymentManager.configureEnvironment(.staging) { config in
    config.apiBaseUrl = "https://staging-api.company.com"
    config.analyticsEnabled = false
    config.featureFlags = ["new_feature": true]
}
```

### 3. Your First Deployment

```swift
// Create deployment configuration
let deployment = Deployment(
    appId: "com.company.app",
    version: "1.2.3",
    buildNumber: "456",
    channel: .testFlight
)

// Execute deployment
do {
    let result = try await deploymentManager.deploy(deployment)
    print("✅ Deployment successful: \(result)")
} catch {
    print("❌ Deployment failed: \(error)")
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Deployment Manager

The `EnterpriseDeploymentManager` is the main entry point for all deployment operations. It orchestrates the entire deployment process and manages different deployment channels.

### Deployment Configuration

`DeploymentConfiguration` allows you to customize deployment behavior:

- **Automated Deployment**: Enable automatic deployment pipelines
- **Rollback Support**: Enable safe rollback capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Enable real-time deployment monitoring
- **Analytics**: Enable deployment analytics and reporting

### Environments

The framework supports multiple environments:

- **Development**: For development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production testing
- **Production**: For live production deployment

### Distribution Channels

The framework supports multiple distribution channels:

- **App Store**: Public App Store distribution
- **TestFlight**: Beta testing distribution
- **MDM**: Enterprise MDM distribution
- **Custom**: Custom enterprise distribution

## Configuration Examples

### App Store Deployment

```swift
let appStoreManager = AppStoreManager(
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    issuerId: "YOUR_ISSUER_ID",
    keyId: "YOUR_KEY_ID"
)

let app = AppStoreApp(
    bundleId: "com.company.app",
    name: "My Enterprise App",
    version: "1.2.3",
    buildNumber: "456",
    platform: .iOS,
    metadata: AppStoreMetadata()
)

let result = try await appStoreManager.submitApp(app)
```

### TestFlight Deployment

```swift
let testFlightManager = TestFlightManager(
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    issuerId: "YOUR_ISSUER_ID",
    keyId: "YOUR_KEY_ID"
)

let build = TestFlightBuild(
    bundleId: "com.company.app",
    version: "1.2.3",
    buildNumber: "456",
    platform: .iOS,
    filePath: "/path/to/app.ipa",
    metadata: BuildMetadata()
)

let result = try await testFlightManager.uploadBuild(build)
```

### MDM Deployment

```swift
let mdmManager = MDMManager(
    serverUrl: "https://mdm.company.com",
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
)

let app = MDMApp(
    bundleId: "com.company.app",
    name: "Enterprise App",
    version: "1.2.3",
    buildNumber: "456",
    filePath: "/path/to/app.ipa",
    installationType: .required,
    removalDate: nil
)

let devices = [device1, device2, device3]
let result = try await mdmManager.distributeApp(app, to: devices)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Environment Management

- Use separate configurations for each environment
- Test deployments in staging before production
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Monitor deployment success rates

### 2. Security

- Secure API keys and credentials
- Use code signing for all builds
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow enterprise security standards

### 3. Monitoring

- Enable real-time monitoring
- Set up alerts for deployment failures
- Track deployment analytics
- Monitor performance metrics

### 4. Rollback Strategy

- Always enable rollback support
- Test rollback procedures
- Maintain deployment history
- Document rollback procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify API keys and credentials
   - Check Apple Developer account permissions
   - Ensure proper certificate configuration

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check Xcode project configuration
   - Verify code signing settings
   - Review build logs for errors

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server configurations
   - Review deployment logs
